## Linear Regression for House Price Prediction on Kaggle Dataset

This code implements a Linear Regression model on a Kaggle dataset designed for predicting house prices. The dataset comprises various parameters related to houses, and the goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on these input features.

### Overview:

- **Dataset Source:** Kaggle
- **Objective:** Predict house prices using Linear Regression
- **Parameters:** The dataset includes features such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and proximity to oceans.

### Key Steps:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - Utilizes popular Python libraries including scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

2. **Data Loading:**
   - Loads the Kaggle dataset containing information about houses.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleans and preprocesses the data, handling missing values and ensuring the dataset is suitable for training.

4. **Linear Regression Model:**
   - Implements a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class.

5. **Training the Model:**
   - Fits the model to the training data, learning the relationship between input features and house prices.

6. **Prediction:**
   - Utilizes the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.

### Dependencies:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning tasks.
